D. Robb. The woman\u2019s body was found in the early morning, on a bench in a New York City playground. She was clean, her hair neatly arranged, her makeup carefully applied. But other things were very wrong\u2014like the tattoo and piercings, clearly new. The clothes, decades out of date. The fatal wound hidden beneath a ribbon around her neck. And the note: Bad Mommy, written in crayon as if by a child. Eve Dallas turns to the department\u2019s top profiler, who confirms what seems obvious to Eve: They\u2019re dealing with a killer whose childhood involved some sort of trauma\u2014a situation Eve is all too familiar with herself. Yet the clues suggest a perpetrator who\u2019d be roughly sixty years old, and there are no records of old crimes with a similar MO. What was the trigger that apparently reopened such an old wound and sent someone over the edge? When Eve discovers that other young women\u2014who physically resemble the first victim\u2014have vanished, the clock starts ticking louder. But to solve this case she will need to find her way into a hidden place of dim light and concrete, into the distant past, and into the cold depths of a shattered mind.",

When the accused is behind bars but the crimes start up again, Bryce finds herself at the heart of the investigation. She\u0027ll do whatever it takes to avenge their deaths.

But with a demon wreaking havoc in the city, he\u0027s offered an irresistible deal: help Bryce find the murderer, and his freedom will be within reach. As Bryce and Hunt dig deep into Crescent City\u0027s underbelly, they discover a dark power that threatens everything and everyone they hold dear, and they find, in each other, a blazing passion-one that could set them both free, if they\u0027d only let it.

Maas delves into the heartache of loss, the price of freedom-and the power of love.",

The year: 1956. Decades have passed since Eddie Lowery came to fame as the ten-year-old caddie to U.S. Open Champion Francis Ouimet. Now a wealthy car dealer and avid supporter of amateur golf, Lowery has just made a bet with fellow millionaire George Coleman. Lowery claims that two of his employees, amateur golfers Harvie Ward and Ken Venturi, cannot be beaten in a best-ball match, and challenges Coleman to bring any two golfers of his choice to the course at 10 a.m. the next day to settle the issue. Coleman accepts the challenge and shows up with his own power team: Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson, the game\u0027s greatest living professionals, with fourteen major championships between them. In Mark Frost\u0027s peerless hands, complete with the recollections of all the participants, the story of this immortal foursome and the game they played that day-legendarily known in golf circles as the greatest private match ever played-comes to life with powerful, emotional impact and edge-of-your-seat suspense.",

So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.

Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life\u2014until the unthinkable happens. Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder.

We take it for granted that we can remember, feel emotion, navigate, empathise and understand the world around us, but how would our lives change if these abilities were dramatically enhanced \u2013 or disappeared overnight? Helen Thomson has spent years travelling the world, tracking down incredibly rare brain disorders. In Unthinkable she tells the stories of nine extraordinary people she encountered along the way. From the man who thinks he\u0027s a tiger to the doctor who feels the pain of others just by looking at them to a woman who hears music that\u2019s not there, their experiences illustrate how the brain can shape our lives in unexpected and, in some cases, brilliant and alarming ways. Story by remarkable story, Unthinkable takes us on an unforgettable journey through the human brain. Discover how to forge memories that never disappear, how to grow an alien limb and how to make better decisions. Learn how to hallucinate and how to make yourself happier in a split second. Find out how to avoid getting lost, how to see more of your reality, even how exactly you can confirm you are alive. Think the unthinkable.",

In the eleventh book in the multimillion-selling Killing series, Bill O\u2019Reilly and Martin Dugard reveal the startling, dramatic story of the global war against terrorists. In Killing The Killers, #1 bestselling authors Bill O\u0027Reilly and Martin Dugard take readers deep inside the global war on terror, which began more than twenty years ago on September 11, 2001. As the World Trade Center buildings collapsed, the Pentagon burned, and a small group of passengers fought desperately to stop a third plane from completing its deadly flight plan, America went on war footing. Killing The Killers narrates America\u0027s intense global war against extremists who planned and executed not only the 9/11 attacks, but hundreds of others in America and around the world, and who eventually destroyed entire nations in their relentless quest for power. Killing The Killers moves from Afghanistan to Iraq, Iran to Yemen, Syria, and Libya, and elsewhere, as the United States fought Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, as well as individually targeting the most notorious leaders of these groups. With fresh detail and deeply-sourced information, O\u0027Reilly and Dugard create an unstoppable account of the most important war of our era. Killing The Killers is the most thrilling and suspenseful book in the #1 bestselling series of popular history books (over 18 million sold) in the world.",

FOX News host Pete Hegseth is back with what he says is his most important book yet: A revolutionary road map to saving our children from leftist indoctrination. Behind a smokescreen of \u201Cpreparing students for the new industrial economy,\u201D early progressives had political control in mind. America\u2019s original schools didn\u2019t just make kids memorize facts or learn skills; they taught them to think freely and arrive at wisdom. They assigned the classics, inspired love of God and country, and raised future citizens that changed the world forever. Today, after 16,000 hours of K-12 indoctrination, our kids come out of government schools hating America. They roll their eyes at religion and disdain our history. We spend more money on education than ever, but kids can barely read and write\u2014let alone reason with discernment. Western culture is on the ropes. Kids are bored and aimless, flailing for purpose in a system that says racial and gender identity is everything. Battle for the American Mind is the untold story of the Progressive plan to neutralize the basis of our Republic \u2013 by removing the one ingredient that had sustained Western Civilization for thousands of years. Pete Hegseth and David Goodwin explain why, no matter what political skirmishes conservatives win, progressives are winning the war\u2014and control the \u201Csupply lines\u201D of future citizens. Reversing this reality will require parents to radically reorient their children\u2019s education; even most homeschooling and Christian schooling are infused with progressive assumptions. We need to recover a lost philosophy of education \u2013 grounded in virtue and excellence \u2013 that can arm future generations to fight for freedom. It\u2019s called classical Christian education. Never heard of it? You\u2019re not alone. Battle for the American Mind is more than a book; it\u2019s a field guide for remaking school in the United States. We\u2019ve ceded our kids\u2019 minds to the left for far too long\u2014this book gives patriotic parents the ammunition to join an insurgency that gives America a fighting chance.",

Tom Felton\u2019s adolescence was anything but ordinary. His early rise to fame in beloved films like The Borrowers catapulted him into the limelight, but nothing could prepare him for what was to come after he landed the iconic role of the Draco Malfoy, the bleached blonde villain of the Harry Potter movies. For the next ten years, he was at the center of a huge pop culture phenomenon and yet, in between filming, he would go back to being a normal teenager trying to fit into a normal school. Speaking with great candor and his signature humor, Tom shares his experience growing up as part of the wizarding world while also trying to navigate the muggle world. He tells stories from his early days in the business like his first acting gig where he was mistaken for fellow blonde child actor Macaulay Culkin and his Harry Potter audition where, in a very Draco-like move, he fudged how well he knew the books the series was based on (not at all). He reflects on his experiences working with cinematic greats such as Alan Rickman, Sir Michael Gambon, Dame Maggie Smith, and Ralph Fiennes (including that awkward Voldemort hug). And, perhaps most poignantly, he discusses the lasting relationships he made over that decade of filming, including with Emma Watson, who started out as a pesky nine-year-old whom he mocked for not knowing what a boom mic was but who soon grew into one of his dearest friends. Then, of course, there are the highs and lows of fame and navigating life after such a momentous and life-changing experience. Tom Felton\u2019s Beyond the Wand is an entertaining, funny, and poignant must-read for any Harry Potter fan. Prepare to meet a real-life wizard.",

The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is \u201Cone of those tech demi-gods with whom we\u2019re all on a first name basis.\u201D Bix is forty, with four kids, restless, and desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or \u201Cexternalizing\u201D memory. Within a decade, Bix\u2019s new technology, \u201COwn Your Unconscious\u201D\u2014which allows you access to every memory you\u2019ve ever had, and to share your memories in exchange for access to the memories of others\u2014has seduced multitudes.

Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles\u2014from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter, and a chapter of tweets. Intellectually dazzling, The Candy House is also a moving testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for connection, family, privacy, and love. \u201CA beautiful exploration of loss, memory, and history\u201D (San Francisco Chronicle), \u201Cthis is minimalist maximalism.

Rich socialite, inveterate flirt, and walking disaster Tennalhin Halkana can read minds. Tennal, like all neuromodified \u201Creaders,\u201D is a security threat on his own. But when controlled, readers are a rare asset. Not only can they read minds, but they can navigate chaotic space, the maelstroms surrounding the gateway to the wider universe. Conscripted into the military under dubious circumstances, Tennal is placed into the care of Lieutenant Surit Yeni, a duty-bound soldier, principled leader, and the son of a notorious traitor general. Whereas Tennal can read minds, Surit can influence them. Like all other neuromodified \u201Carchitects,\u201D he can impose his will onto others, and he\u2019s under orders to control Tennal by merging their minds. Surit accepted a suspicious promotion-track request out of desperation, but he refuses to go through with his illegal orders to sync and control an unconsenting Tennal. So they lie: They fake a sync bond and plan Tennal\u0027s escape. Their best chance arrives with a salvage-retrieval mission into chaotic space\u2014to the very neuromodifcation lab that Surit\u0027s traitor mother destroyed twenty years ago. And among the rubble is a treasure both terrible and unimaginably powerful, one that upends a decades-old power struggle, and begins a war. Tennal and Surit can no longer abandon their unit or their world. The only way to avoid life under full military control is to complete the very sync they\u0027ve been faking. Can two unwilling weapons of war bring about peace? At the Publisher\u0027s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

When Torran offers her enough credits to not only keep her crew afloat but also hire someone to fix her ship, Tavi knows that she can\u2019t refuse\u2014no matter how much she\u2019d like to. With so much money on the line, Torran and his crew insist on joining the hunt.

With the fate of her crew balanced on a knife\u2019s edge, Tavi must decide where her loyalties lie\u2014with the quiet Valoff who\u2019s been lying to her, or with the human leaders who left her squad to die on the battlefield.

Clarke award-winning author. \u0022There are few who write science fiction like Ann Leckie can. There are few who ever could.\u0022 \u2014John Scalzi Qven was created to be a Presger translator. The pride of their Clade, they always had a clear path before them: learn human ways, and eventually, make a match and serve as an intermediary between the dangerous alien Presger and the human worlds. The realization that they might want something else isn\u0027t \u0022optimal behavior\u0022. I\u0027s the type of behavior that results in elimination. But Qven rebels. And in doing so, their path collides with those of two others. Enae, a reluctant diplomat whose dead grandmaman has left hir an impossible task as an inheritance: hunting down a fugitive who has been missing for over 200 years. And Reet, an adopted mechanic who is increasingly desperate to learn about his genetic roots\u2014or anything that might explain why he operates so differently from those around him. As a Conclave of the various species approaches\u2014and the long-standing treaty between the humans and the Presger is on the line\u2014the decisions of all three will have ripple effects across the stars. Masterfully merging space adventure and mystery, and a poignant exploration about relationships and belonging, Translation State is a triumphant new standalone story set in the celebrated Imperial Radch universe. \u0022Leckie\u2019s humane, emotionally intelligent, and deeply perceptive writing makes this tautly plotted adventure feel fundamentally true while also offering longtime fans a much anticipated glimpse into the Radch\u2019s most mysterious species. Readers will be thrilled.\u0022 \u2014Publishers Weekly (starred review) \u0022Another of Leckie\u2019s beautiful mergings of the political, philosophical, and personal.\u0022 \u2014Kirkus (starred review)",

When Ethan snaps back to DateDate HQ, he\u2019s convinced a coding issue caused the blip. Except for anyone to believe him, he\u2019ll need evidence.
